<br>

<p>
Running a business can be challenging during the best of times, but COVID-19 has presented business owners with obstacles they have never faced before. Whether they have had to switch to virtual services, get their staff working from home, or even shut down temporarily, the fact is that many entrepreneurs are struggling financially during this time. 
</p>
<p>
To help businesses, both the federal and provincial governments are offering assistance such as expanding the work sharing program to offering up to a 75% wage subsidy to companies who have lost at least 30% of their revenue due to COVID-19. Additionally, entrepreneurs are getting extensions on the tax deadlines and breaks on their rent. 
</p>
<p>
Despite all of this help however, many businesses will simply not be able to survive this economic downturn. But that doesn’t have to be your business. Despite the economic turmoil that is happening right now, many businesses are finding ways to survive and even thrive. 
</p>
<p>
But you may need a little help in getting there. 
</p>
<p>
In addition to taking advantage of whatever government programs might be available, your business should consider additional asset based lending (ABL) solutions to help ensure operations can continue until restrictions are lifted and the economy starts trending upward again. 
</p>
