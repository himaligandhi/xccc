                 With our depth of resources, we not only provide funding solutions but also provide a hands-on approach which helps alleviate some of the stress associated 
                 with funding. We don’t just provide approvals and then move on to other clients, we will provide our expertise and knowledge after funding and assist our clients
                 throughout the initial loan period into a transition period to prepare them for the opportunity to apply to the conventional banking for more appealing rates and
                 terms. While we focus on loans of $100,000 to $10,000,000 we have the capability to syndicate larger loans up to $50,000,000. Credit is not a major factor in determining an approval; we provide practical, flexible & creative solutions to each client based on assets, enterprise value & borrowing needs. Here are the funding solutions that we can provide.
